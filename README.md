# Rated Stats — Battleground Enemies (BGE)

Rated Stats — Battleground Enemies is a **Retail, battleground-only** enemy frames addon built for the Rated Stats ecosystem.

It gives you a compact, configurable enemy roster for BGs (including Rated BG / Blitz): readable rows, predictable layout behavior, and PvP-first visuals that respect modern Blizzard UI restrictions.

## What it does

### Enemy roster frames (Battlegrounds)
- Displays the enemy team as a compact list (rows / columns based on your settings).
- Rows can show **live health** and update when unit data is available (scoreboard seeding + live unit bindings where possible).
- Click-to-target support **where permitted** by secure UI rules.

### “Chat-tab” header + quick actions
- A top-left tab (like Blizzard chat windows) that appears on hover.
- Right-click menu actions:
  - Lock / Unlock frame position
  - Settings

### PvP-first visuals
- Transparent background tint based on **enemy faction** (Blue for Alliance, Red for Horde) while keeping the frame readable.
- Out-of-range visuals that reduce clutter without making the frame unusable mid-fight.
- Death handling (rows clearly show when an enemy is dead).

### Optional Rated Stats integration
If you use **Rated Stats – Achievements**, BGE can show a rank/achievement icon context on the enemy list to help you spot high-experience players quickly.

## Limitations (Blizzard restrictions)

Retail’s modern UI rules (secure templates, combat lockdown, “secret” values) mean:
- Some updates cannot happen while in combat (frame sizing/position changes may be blocked).
- Some enemy/unit data is **not immediately available** at match start.
- 12.0.1 has locked down the scoreboard so **leavers and joiners** matching is no longer possible, mostly affecting normal game modes.
